## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the perfect opportunity to apply some flexbox properties that I already knew about, but had not used in other projects. I had difficulty applying the image overlay to apply the color. At first I was trying to apply the filters directly on the image, but then I decided to make a div that overlaps the image.

### Continued development

I continue to improve the way I name my CSS classes, and understanding a little better what semantic HTML looks like.
